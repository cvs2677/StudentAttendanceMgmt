       Asynchronous context manager for handling application lifespan.

       This function is responsible for performing startup and shutdown logic for the FastAPI application.
       During startup, it creates the database if it doesn't exist, creates tables, and creates the first admin user.
       During shutdown, it prints a message indicating that the application is shutting down.

       Parameters:
       app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance.

       Yields:
       None: The application runs within the context of the yield statement.
